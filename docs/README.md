## Desired dir structure for new project

```
.
├── .github
│   └── workflows
│       └── ci-cd.yml            # GitHub Actions workflow
├── src
│   ├── index.js                 # Main application entry point
│   └── package.json             # Node.js dependencies and scripts
├── tests
│   └── app.test.js              # Test scripts
├── Dockerfile                   # Dockerfile for building the application container
├── docker-compose.yml           # Docker Compose file for deployment
└── README.md                    # Project documentation
```

So, you can delete other files and directories that are not needed for your project like `/docs/`, `/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`, `/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`,  etc.
